- To be in React JS (classbased components or functional components, as desired).
- Use a CSS library. Not necessarily MUI if you are comfortable with other libraries (Bootstrap, ANTD, Tailwind, Chakra UI etc.)
- Be responsive up to 460px resolution
- Have 2 (or more) light and dark themes
- Example of application would be a Todo List where:
  - I can create an entry
  - I can edit an entry
  - I can delete an entry both individually and in bulk (in the sense that I select multiple entries and delete them)
  - I can change the status of an entry (to "done" and vice versa) both individually and bulk (in the sense that I select multiple entries and change their status)
  - Using the router to have (a filter) a route for all todo's, a route for those with a status of "done" and a route for "undone".
  - When I do a delete or update action, there should be a modal/notification with "Are you sure that you want to perform this action?" + confirm or cancel button. After deletion or update it should also give a notification (possibly a snackbar) that the change was successful (or not). For storage, you don't need to use a database, you can use Local Storage, Session Storage or simply a React State.

- For those who are feeling masterful, they can store the input states on the back-end (Node JS)
- You can use a draggable library to drag and drop entries, thus changing their order in the list (by ID or index).
  TodoList is just an example. Other colleagues have made applications for real estate, ads, car rentals etc. Here you have a free hand to do what you like.
  - Note: You can use any packages and any resources you want, the condition is that you understand what you have done and can show the functionality of the code.
